Create a README file in your GitHub repo in a folder called assignment0 with the following:
(we will take a look at these sites again close to the end of the term!)

5 websites with aspects that you either like or dislike (such as good or poor layout, presentation of or overload of  information, easy or hard to navigate, loads quickly or slowly considering the data on the page, fun or frustrating, flashy or boring, cute or dreadful, great or poor interactivity, whatever else you might think of!)
A link to the site and what you like or dislike and ways that you think each of the 5 websites might be improved,

- I put the README in the assignment0 folder i made :)

- One website I like is the web version of Youtube Music. (The iPhone app is good too) I have mine in darkmode and I just think it looks really good. It's easy on the eye and looks sleek. It's pretty easy to navigate, loads fast, and has good interactivity. The one thing I think could be improved is that, imo, there is a lot of information on the page when you first load it up and if you've never used Youtube Music before, I imagine it could be a little overwhelming. Not overly so, but it could be simplified a little bit.

- I'll be honest, I don't like Moodle. I'm a Canvas enthusiast. I don't like how there isn't a dark mode (if there is one I have not found it lol), I know I could just download an exstention, but I think that's dumb that I would have to do that. I also don't like how when I go into a course, the sidebar thing scrolls way farther than I actually am. I didn't articulate that super well, but if you're courious enough I can show you. This is purly me being picky, but I don't like the shade of yellow that's on there. One thing I do appriciate is that this new  Moodle def loads fast (at least for me) and looks sleeker (besides the yellow)

- AO3 <3. It has a darkmode, a super in depth tag search system (idk if that made sense), loads pretty quick, organized, and looks nice. This specific site is for reading fanfiction (Im a nerd), and the seraching/tagging system is amazing. You choose to look for works that include/exclude certain things, search for works in a specific language, search for a specific author, etc. You can also make your speific profile customized with CSS which I thought was pretty cool. (There's a ton of other things you can do to customize it, I just haven't tried them) The one thing is that there is a small learning curve to leanring how the tag/search system works, but it's not super hard. The webpage is also super wordy. Like it's literally just words, but for the type of website it is, that makes sense. To access darkmode you also have to have an account which can take a couple of weeks to get since you have to be invited.

- I like the Hoodoo website. It looks nice, well organized, it's pretty flashy, but in a good way, and it has decent interactivity. Sometime's it does load slow, especially when I am trying to load the webcam page. I think the reason for that it the webcames are live (at least i think they are?) so that probably slows it down since there are like 5-6 webcams. Other than that, the website is 'ight

- I strongly dislike Ticketmaster both web and mobile. Not just because of the crazy ticket fees/prices, but their website sucks. No dark mode, slow, logs me out everytime I open it up (web and mobile), I personally don't think it's laid out super well (it's disorganized), and it's kind of ugly. Like it could be uglier, but def isn't pretty. Ig one good thing is I know it's reliable and I won't get scammed if I buy my tickets off of it. Other than that, it sucks.
