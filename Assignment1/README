Assignment 1

This 'website' is basically just an about me page. I don't think I am going to use this for my 'final' website that i make for this class, I just needed a simple way to show all the requirments for this assignment. I want the top to just be my name and maybe a small blurb about me or smt like that. Then a hamburger menu with different tabs about things i like/do. I'd love to figure out how to get like one of those rotating picture banners to go right under my name. I'd also like to make the whole thing look better, rn it's giving "webpage from like the 90's or smt" 

I also couldn't get the video to show up right and I'm not sure why. It does take you to Youtube to play it though if u click the link so ig it sort of works? I also did this without watching Fri video so that's why i probably messed up some things bc I was just winging it with Google lol
