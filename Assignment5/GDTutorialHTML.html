      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <hr class = "hdrline"></hr>
      <p id = "intropara">Originally developed by Thomas Boutell, Graphics Draw is an open sourced PHP library that can be used to create and manipulate images
      dynamically in PHP. You can create images in many different formats including PNG, JPEG, GIF,
      XPM, and WBMP. GD has functions that allows for the user to create images from scratch,
      draw things directly on an image, and manipulate images. There are many uses for the GD library including image generation, 
      text rendering, CAPTCHA generation, data visualization, etc.

      <h1>Requirments and Set Up</h1>
      <hr class = "hdrline"></hr>
      <h3>Requirments:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You must have PHP with the GD extenstion installed. To check this, create a php file with "phpinfo()" and seach for GD in the output. If you don't
          have it installed, I'd suggest Googling it because Google can explain it way better than I can. 
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you have the specific libraries for the image formats you want to use installed. GD has different libraries for different formats which
          are usually installed by default, but if you are using a specific format, you may need to install the right library for that which you can find on Google.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Set Up:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Enable the GD extension. Find the "php.ini" config file and find ";extension=gd" line. Uncomments it if it's commented out. Restart the web server for
          the changes to appear. 
        </li>
        <li>To check if it's working, run this code in a new php file.</li>

    <div id = "content">
      <p>"imagecreate()" is a function in PHP's GD library. You can use this function to create an image with specific dimensions.
        You can also change the colors on an image, draw shapes, or add text using this function (see examples below)<br>
        <br><strong>imagecreate(w,h):</strong> Used to make a new image with specified width and height
        <br><strong>imagecollorallocate($image (rgb)):</strong> Used to set the colors for your image/drawing
        <br><strong>imagettftext():</strong> Used to add text to an image. Must include font file, size, angle, position, and text string
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type = "button" class = "collaps">Image Manipulation</button>
    <div id = "content">
      <p>To use image manipulation in PHP using GD, you have to load an existing image, apply the modifications you want, and then
         save/display the modified image. Some things you can do to manipulate your images are resizing, adding text, adding shapes,
         and filters (see examples below)<br>
         <br><strong>imagecopyresampled():</strong> Used to resize an image and also keeps its aspect ratio. Source image, destination image, and the new dimensions are the parameters.
         <br><strong>imagefilledrectangle():</strong> Used to draw different shapes on an image. Note: there are different functions for different shapes
         <br><strong>imagefilter():</strong> Used to apply different filters on an image. Some examples are contrast, blur, brightness, grayscale, etc. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <button type = "button" class = "collaps">Image Output</button>
    <div id = "content">
      <p>The 3 most commonly used image outputs are 'imagejpeg()', 'imagepng()', and 'imagegif()'. These functions are used to send
        send an image's data to a browser or to save it to a file. (see examples below)<br>
        <br><strong>imagejpeg($image, $filename, $quality):</strong>Note: There are optional parameters not listed here. This function
        outputs a jpeg image with the GD image resource, an optional filename and quality parameters.
