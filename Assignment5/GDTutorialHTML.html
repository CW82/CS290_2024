      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <hr id = "hdrline"></hr>
      <p id = "intropara">Originally developed by Thomas Boutell, Graphics Draw is an open sourced PHP library that can be used to create and manipulate images
      dynamically in PHP. You can create images in many different formats including PNG, JPEG, GIF,
      XPM, and WBMP. GD has functions that allows for the user to create images from scratch,
      draw things directly on an image, and manipulate images. There are many uses for the GD library including image generation, 
      text rendering, CAPTCHA generation, data visualization, etc.

      <h1>Requirments and Set Up</h1>
      <hr id = "hdrline"></hr>
      <h3>Requirments:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You must have PHP with the GD extenstion installed. To check this, create a php file with "phpinfo()" and seach for GD in the output. If you don't
          have it installed, I'd suggest Googling it because Google can explain it way better than I can. 
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you have the specific libraries for the image formats you want to use installed. GD has different libraries for different formats which
          are usually installed by default, but if you are using a specific format, you may need to install the right library for that which you can find on Google.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Set Up:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Enable the GD extension. Find the "php.ini" config file and find ";extension=gd" line. Uncomments it if it's commented out. Restart the web server for
          the changes to appear. 
        </li>
        <li>To check if it's working, run this code in a new php file.</li>
      </ol>
