1: Super simple basic site to show PHP server side stuff :), I sued php bc i couldn't wrap my head around making a server in python??? Like i get it somewhat, but php just made more sense to me so I figured i'd just do that lol
2: Im not sure why all of the entries are on the same line, but i just want to get this turned in lmao

5: I used  chatgpt to explain some things to me in simpiler terms lol, but the links above are basically all i used to figure out how to make the php work
6: https://youtu.be/6HVYX8FRSGA <--- THIS video was sooo good at helping me figure out what I was doing with php, how to set up, a basic tutorial on literally everything, soooo good :))))))

- Create a web app that shows some simple server-side scripting, perhaps two buttons or forms where one calls a function on the server that writes something to a file and another that retrieves that text

- Go find some plugin, module, or whatever your server-side environment uses to enhance its framework and create a website that shows off that module (perhaps by going through a tutorial for that module?).
