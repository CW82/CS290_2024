Open "NeatFlix 3.0" first. You'll be able to login using the email and password below (hopefully, it worked for me at least)

NOTE: The log in information is

Email: example@example.com
Password: 123456789             

1: Input, output, variable (few different datatypes, number, string, boolean, couple of objs), common errors and how to possibly avoid, conditionals, repitition, arrays, functions, demonstrait scope, objects, events

2: To show input and output I want to have some test email/password and when you press 'sign in' it take you to the 'welcome' page

3: For events, I want the 'Need Help' button to run away from the cursor because i think that will be funny and because i haven't done anything for that page lmao

4: Common errors in javascript include not spelling things right, missing a (){}[]; , forgetting 'let' 'var', not making something global and then trying to use it, using the wrong = == ===, etc. How to avoid these? Honestly, what I did was accidently do these errors, get mad because it's not working, look at the console, forget what something means, use Google, then fix it. Ig i could've gone slower/been more careful when i was coding it, but eh, i like doing things the hard way :)

 - I used ChatGPT a little bit and I had it explain some of the things from those links in more simple terms (brain smooth XÔπèX)

6: I want to eventually make it so when I press the enter key it also acts as pressing the 'sign in' button, but this assignment is already super late so that's an issue I'll take care of later lmao

7: im working on actually making the hamburger menu functional, again, this was super late, so this is on the bottom of my to do this, sorry

8: 'tbw' = to be watched

9: Only the add button on 'watch list' works, just trying to get this turned in, will get others to work later
