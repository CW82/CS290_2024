1: Input, output, variable (few different datatypes, number, string, boolean, couple of objs), common errors and how to possibly avoid, conditionals, repitition, arrays, functions, demonstrait scope, objects, events

2: To show input and output I want to have some test email/password and when you press 'sign in' it take you to the 'welcome' page

3: For events, I want the 'Need Help' button to run away from the cursor because i think that will be funny and because i haven't done anything for that page lmao

4: Common errors in javascript include not spelling things right, missing a (){}[]; , forgetting 'let' 'var', not making something global and then trying to use it, using the wrong = == ===, etc. How to avoid these? Honestly, what I did was accidently do these errors, get mad because it's not working, look at the console, forget what something means, use Google, then fix it. Ig i could've gone slower/been more careful when i was coding it, but eh
