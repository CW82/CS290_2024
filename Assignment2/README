I just remebered i was supposed to write a read me for this assignment lmao. i included the picture
of my inspo for this assignment and I used a lot of googling to help me get this to where it is. I think
it meets all the requirments, it's not super pretty, but it does work and it's on the way to being what i want it 
to be. The next iteration of this should be a lot more organized and hopefully not crooked. 

Design: Ig Im designing this based off of the Netflix sign in page. By the end of this class I hope to be able to sign in using a dummy 
account. II had my friend send me her list of TV shows she has that she wants to watch and has watched. I want the final webpage
to be able to display what she has wathced, her watch list, and maybe if I'm feeling zesty I can include a ranking system of sorts.
