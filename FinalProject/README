EDIT:

Now, go re-review each of the sites you picked at the start of the term, reviewing them now with your new knowledge of web development might make you notice more of some kinds of problems and make some of the problems less of a problem.  Be sure to include any thoughts you have on why your thoughts or opinions might have changed.

- YouTube Music: I still stand by what I said, this site is nice, fast, well organzied, and has good interactivity. The only thing I complained about was it was a little bit cluttered, but I take that back now because now on closer inspection, everything on the page at a given time has a placce and a function. None of it is just random junk/decoration. So while it may look visually cluttered, it's actually super well layed out. 

- Moodle: I still like Canvas better. One new problem i noticed (me being super picky) is that when you hover over the title and home/dashboard/my courses, it changes the background color to a whitish color so you can diferentiate it from the (ugly) yellow of the rest of the nav bar. My complaint is that the messenger and notification bell on the other side don't do that, only the cursor changes to a pointer. It would be nice if both sides did the whitish background color change, but again, just me being super picky. 

- A03: I love AO3 and still don't have any complaints about it. <3

- Hoodoo: Same opinion, sometimes it's a little laggy, but the usability isn't affected. 8/10

- TicketMaster (tbh when i did this one, I was mad bc I didn't get tickets I wanted, that's why i tore it to shreds. I still stand by what I said): The biggest issue i have with Ticketmaster is that I have to resign in every time i open the site, web or mobile. That gets really annoying. One possibility on why that's happening is maybe because the cookies arent storing the information for each session. If that's the case, it seems like it should be an easy fix :'(

Lastly, go review each of your own projects from the point of view of the aspects that you liked and disliked at the start of the term.

Preface: my friend has a spreadsheet with things she wants to watch, has watched, haven't watched, etc. She also has a rating system and stuff that I want to add on to this website later. I decided to make it into a Netflix dupe so she could have a place to organize everything in a cuter way (im a google sheets hater). 

- Assignment1: it's giving, 90's website. Ill be real, i could've def made something better bc i had some background knowledge of html/css, but i just wanted to meet the requirments and get it over with

- Assignment2: the idea was there, the execution was not. I think I shot a little too high. I def should've organzied literally everything better, it was all just kind of jumbled around. Had i organized it, it probably would've looked better/had less issues 

- Assignment3: I have no qualms against this assignment, I think i greatly imporved the organization which then made the website look and act how I wanted. Kind of wish i finished the 'need help' page or did smt else with it, but again, pleased with how this one turned out all around

- Assignment4: Ugh, lost all motivation for this. Sort of struggled with the js, but am more confortable with it now. Spent an ungodly amount of time getting my stupid button to work right. I'm happy with how it turned out tho, def couldn've been worse

- Assignment5: I've made better, I wish I hadn't taken so long to do it lol. I enjoyed learning PHP for it, I think that will really help me out in the future since it's such a flexible (idk if that was the right word) language. As of rn, im still making the second part of this assignment better, im trying to make collapable container. I still have yet to make the nav bar functional/add php to it, but we're getting there, just super super slowly

- Assignment6: I gave up on the 'Neatflix' idea :(, it got too busy and i couldnt envision a design that I liked enough to turn in. I'm actually very pleased with what I have finished though, I actually made the broswer icon myself so im proud of that
