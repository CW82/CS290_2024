1:Now, go re-review each of the sites you picked at the start of the term, reviewing them now with your new knowledge of web development might make you notice more of some kinds of problems and make some of the problems less of a problem.  Be sure to include any thoughts you have on why your thoughts or opinions might have changed.

Preface: my friend has a spreadsheet with things she wants to watch, has watched, haven't watched, etc. She also has a rating system and stuff that I want to add on to this website later. I decided to make it into a Netflix dupe so she could have a place to organize everything in a cuter way (im a google sheets hater). 

- Assignment1: it's giving, 90's website. Ill be real, i could've def made something better bc i had some background knowledge of html/css, but i just wanted to meet the requirments and get it over with

- Assignment2: the idea was there, the execution was not. I think I shot a little too high. I def should've organzied literally everything better, it was all just kind of jumbled around. Had i organized it, it probably would've looked better/had less issues 

- Assignment3: I have no qualms against this assignment, I think i greatly imporved the organization which then made the website look and act how I wanted. Kind of wish i finished the 'need help' page or did smt else with it, but again, pleased with how this one turned out all around

- Assignment4: Ugh, lost all motivation for this. Sort of struggled with the js, but am more confortable with it now. Spent an ungodly amount of time getting my stupid button to work right. I'm happy with how it turned out tho, def couldn've been worse

- Assignment5: As of rn, I haaven't finishe it lol

- Assignment6: See above lmao
