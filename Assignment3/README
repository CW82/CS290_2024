1: I finally finished the 'login' page and the inputs for email/phone and password don't float away when you expand/minimize
the screen, Yippee(❁´◡`❁)

2: I am going to start the 'home screen' for this. Essentially, my friend has an excel sheet of things she wants to eventially
watch with ratings, genre, where to watch, etc catagories. So im going to make it look cute and organized (hopefully)
