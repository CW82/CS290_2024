1: I finally finished the 'login' page and the inputs for email/phone and password don't float away when you expand/minimize the screen, Yippee(❁´◡`❁)

2: I am going to start the 'home screen' for this. Essentially, my friend has an excel sheet of things she wants to eventiallywatch with ratings, genre, where to watch, etc catagories. So im going to make it look cute and organized (hopefully)

3: Subtle background thing, if you make the window small enough, the background of the nav menu
is a stars gif, they'll twinkle and be cute and stuff lol

4: Took inspo from W3 schools and used fontawesome for my icon
