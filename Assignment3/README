1: I finally finished the 'login' page and the inputs for email/phone and password don't float away when you expand/minimize the screen, Yippee(❁´◡`❁)

2: I am going to start the 'home screen' for this. Essentially, my friend has an excel sheet of things she wants to eventiallywatch with ratings, genre, where to watch, etc catagories. So im going to make it look cute and organized (hopefully)

3: Subtle background thing, if you make the window small enough, the background of the nav menu
is a stars gif, they'll twinkle and be cute and stuff lol Edit: *had a cute starry background, had to get rid of it because it wasn't working for some reason and I decided it looked stupid

4: Took inspo from W3 schools and used fontawesome for my icon

5: I used some z-index stuff on assignment2 so i figured that was good enough to meet the requirment for this one :)

6: I went with a horizontal nav list, I know the assignment said to do both technically, but i have already turned this in days late, i can switch this to a verticle one pretty quickly if you really want to see it that way lol

7: idk why the icon for the menu doesn't stay on the right side, i have it float:right? Idk there's probably something overiding it or smt 

8: I feel like i showed inheritence in this code, one example being how the 'title' class is in the 'navbarstyle' class. It gets some of the styling from there, but then, bc i made it its own class, i added some extra styling to emphasize it's the title

9: idk if it technically counts as 'fluid and responsive layout' but the hompage does technically adjust to the pixel size of the screen when it gets smaller. The nav bar at the top shrinks into the hamburger menu. IK the exmaple you used in class was the columns going from next to eachother down to just one dpending on the size of the screen, but as of rn i haven't done that lol

10: I think there's a couple things this doesn't meet, but it's a week late at this point so im turning it in as is lmao
